Helping vegetable gardeners visualize their harvests.

Have you ever wondered how much produce you have grown and money you have saved because of it?  Do you have a tough time remebering what you planted the previous year, and how many days each plant takes to mature? Use Fruitful to start tracking your garden's progress!  My goal is to turn this into a mint.com for garden enthusiasts. 

This is a MEAN stack web app (Mongodb, Express, Angular.js, Node.js).  Other technologies used include Chart.js & Bootstrap.
